I had this idea; I was thinking for a while when I was trying to place props in Blender, specifically weapons and other kinds of props. 

Thankfully, with the help of AI, my add-on idea came to fruition, as I had never done coding before other than changing some values from a guide or someone telling me what I should do for some modding software for games on VS Code.

I'm still a beginner when it comes to coding myself, so maybe I should try to get into it more later on.
